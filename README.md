# **Cinema Project**

This is the Cinema Project, a web application for browsing and searching movies and series using the **[The Movie DataBase API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)**. The project is built with Vue.js 3, TypeScript, Vuex, Vue Router, Axios, and Tailwind CSS.

## **Installation Choices**

We have chosen the following technologies and tools for the project:

- Vue.js 3: As our main front-end framework for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: To provide static typing and better tooling for our codebase.
- Vuex: For managing our application's global state.
- Vue Router: To handle client-side routing between the various pages of our app.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- ESLint: To enforce a consistent code style and catch potential issues early.
- Prettier: For consistent code formatting.
- Jest: As our testing framework for writing unit tests.

The **`package.json`** file lists all the dependencies and scripts required for this project.
